# Terminal Agent

🖥️ **Terminal Agent** is a standalone agent designed to handle and execute shell commands based on user queries. It runs shell commands directly within a terminal environment, performs the required operations, and returns the output to the user.

## 🛠️ **Core Functionality**

1. **Execute Shell Commands**: 
   - The agent processes the user's query by executing corresponding shell commands.
   - It returns the results of the command execution back to the user.
   
2. **Command-Line Operations**:
   - Handles typical shell-based tasks such as file manipulation, network operations, package management, and more.
   
3. **Error Handling**:
   - Provides clear feedback when a command fails or encounters an error during execution.

## 📚 **How to Use**

1. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the agent:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. Enter your command when prompted, and the Terminal Agent will execute it.

## 🧩 **Features**
- **Simple Interface**: The agent runs directly in your terminal and handles user queries for shell commands.
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on various platforms such as Linux, macOS, and Windows (with appropriate shell setup).
- **Standalone**: This project is fully independent and not part of any other system.

## 🚀 **Future Enhancements**
- **Command Suggestions**: In future versions, the agent may suggest shell commands based on user input.
- **History Tracking**: Ability to track previously executed commands and results.
- **Remote Execution**: Support for running commands on remote machines via SSH.
